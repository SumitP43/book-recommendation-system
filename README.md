# book-recommendation-system
The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning–based web application that suggests books to users based on similarity between books. It helps users discover relevant books efficiently by analyzing book features and user preferences.  This project uses content-based filtering and Cosine Similarity to recommend books similar to the one selected

# Abstract
The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning–driven web application designed to provide personalized book suggestions based on content similarity. The system analyzes book metadata and recommends similar books using mathematical similarity measures, helping users discover relevant reading material efficiently.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an intelligent recommendation system that minimizes user effort in searching for suitable books while demonstrating the practical application of machine learning algorithms in a real-world web environment.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Flask (Backend Framework)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library)  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Google Colab (Model Training & Experimentation)

---

## Methodology
This system implements a **content-based recommendation approach**. Book features such as title, author, genre, and ratings are vectorized, and **Cosine Similarity** is applied to measure the similarity between books. Based on these similarity scores, the most relevant books are recommended to the user.

## System Features
- Accurate book recommendations using machine learning  
- Efficient and lightweight Flask backend  
- User-friendly interface  
- Scalable and modular architecture
