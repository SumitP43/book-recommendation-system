# 📚 Book Recommendation System

The **Book Recommendation System** is a machine learning–based web application that suggests books to users based on the similarity between books. It helps users discover relevant books efficiently by analyzing book features and user preferences.

This project uses **content-based filtering** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend books similar to the one selected by the user.

## 📝 Abstract

The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning–driven web application designed to provide personalized book suggestions based on content similarity. The system analyzes book metadata and recommends similar books using mathematical similarity measures, helping users discover relevant reading material efficiently.

The application is implemented using **Flask** for the backend and **Scikit-learn** for building the recommendation logic.

## ⚙️ Methodology

This project follows a **content-based recommendation approach**. Book attributes such as title, author, genre, and ratings are processed and transformed into numerical vectors.  
**Cosine Similarity** is then used to compute similarity scores between books, and the most similar books are recommended to the user.
